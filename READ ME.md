# dungeon crawler
dungeon crawler is my own attempt at making my own dungeon crawler in python, pygame. It uses three charactors which you switch through to play the level

## Required python libs
require pygame
can use the pyton pip installer with `pip install pygame`

## How to install
download all the files and run main.py

## How to play
you switch between three charactors with `Space`, each charactor has a special ability/attack which can be accessed with `s`, movment is `a`, `d` for horizonatl movment and `w` to jump
